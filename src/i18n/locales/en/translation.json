    "title": "About Me",
    "journeyTitle": "My Journey",
    "journey1": "I started my career in welding and metal fabrication at the age of 15 as an apprentice. At first, I did not plan to pursue this profession, but seeing the solid and clean results at the end of each job gradually made me passionate about the work. Over the years, I gained hands-on experience by working on construction sites and industrial facilities, truly learning the trade from the ground up.\n\nAfter years of experience, I left salaried employment, invested in my own equipment, and established my own business with the support of my professional network. Today, I provide services using MIG/MAG, TIG, and ARC (electrode) welding methods, specializing in steel construction, stainless steel fabrication, welded manufacturing, and on-site installation. I carefully choose the most suitable welding technique for each project to ensure long-lasting strength and reliability.\n\nWhether the work is carried out in the workshop or on-site, I approach every project with a planned, disciplined, and solution-oriented mindset. From measurement and cutting to bending, welding, and installation, every stage is handled with precision and care. My top priorities are structural durability, workplace safety, meeting commitments, and delivering on time.\n\nI take pride in my work and truly enjoy what I do. Being able to deliver reliable, high-quality results and stand behind my work with confidence is my greatest motivation.",
